TO DO:
In lieu of resource_manager.get_sprites_from_sheet(), try working straight from the sheets 

Calling set_colorkey(BLACK) is causing issues with the background images

*Eliminate agent positions entirely, use only rects. Their positions will be
    agent.rect.topleft

Currently, events are events.Event class instances that passed to post() and notify().
    It could be more efficient if they were simply global constants. If additional info
    is needed (eg mouse_pos on a MOUSE_CLICK event) we could pass it along as a *kwarg

Change game_state ids to constants

Implement game_state stack to allow back and forward state transitions

Switch to vectors for movement

*Rethink the draw loop. Currently, we are update()ing only the absolute positions of agents
    (relative to the map), and compensating for the camera offset in the draw() calls. The 
    idea being that there is no sense updating positions every update() if the positions
    are only modified during action updates (eg 'Move' command)

*Faster tile_grid blitting-- Blit all of the tiles to one surface and then draw the surface
    on draw()

*Use dirt rects- Blit a piece of the background over the sprite's current location, erasing it.
    Append the sprite's current location rectangle to a list called dirty_rects.
    Move the sprite.
    Draw the sprite at it's new location.
    Append the sprite's new location to my dirty_rects list.
    Call display.update(dirty_rects)

Possible events to use callbacks: camera.Camera.center()

Make transition for Camera.center(). Have it gradually move to new position.
